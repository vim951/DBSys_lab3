# DBSys_lab3
Repository used to report the work of Hugo DANET and VIctor MASIAK for part 3 of the EURECOM DBSys lab on Java Minibase.

# Read text files

We have coded two functions allowing to create conditional expressions for simple predicate and double predicates from the txt query files. 
We have also implemented two functions allowing us to read the tables and the columns of the files.

To test the implementations you can uncomment the queries in the runTests function and indicate the path to the queries folder in the String constant path\_to\_queries
